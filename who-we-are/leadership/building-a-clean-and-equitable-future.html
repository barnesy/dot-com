  <h1 class="hed hed--large">Building a Clean and Equitable Future</h1>
  <p>Southern Company Gas exists to serve. First and foremost, we serve more than 4.2 million utility customers and 774,000 retail customers with clean, safe, reliable and affordable natural gas. We serve our more than 4,400 employees. We serve the environments we live in. We serve the communities we operate in. We serve our investors and shareholders.</p>

  <p>Southern Company Gas is focused on serving our stakeholders in a way that is environmentally sustainable, socially responsible and governed ethically. These were always important values for Southern Company Gas, and, as president and CEO, it is my top priority to integrate those values into every area of our business operations.</p>

  <h2 class="hed--medium">Snapshot of What’s in the Pipeline</h2>

  <h3 class="hed--small">We’re taking a portfolio approach to our energy supply. </h3>
  <p>As one of the largest natural gas distribution companies in the country, we are implementing a portfolio-wide approach to decarbonizing our operations, from leading the way in implementing renewable natural gas (RNG) and hydrogen, investing in cutting-edge technologies such as power to gas to capture excess renewable energy, to transitioning millions of customers to any of six paperless billing options and offering award-winning energy efficiency programs. </p>


  <h3 class="hed--small">We’re building equity through our service model.</h3>
  <p>Environmental sustainability goes hand in hand with social responsibility. Our core mission is to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to all customers, neighbors and communities. Low-income families in minority neighborhoods tend to have higher energy cost burdens than those living in predominantly White neighborhoods. Through our natural gas distribution companies, we are committed to empowering low-income communities.</p>

  <p>On such example of our commitment to equity and social responsibility is presented by our investments in Pembroke, Illinois. Pembroke has an unemployment rate of 30.2% and a poverty rate of 33.9%. Many residents do not have access to running water or reliable energy. We’re proud to have Nicor Gas partnering with community leaders and organizations to bring natural gas to this small, often referred to as “forgotten,” township. Extending a natural gas pipeline into the township would not only give access to clean and reliable energy but would also fuel the local economy, creating jobs and encouraging businesses to locate in the community.</p>


  <h3 class="hed--small">We pay close attention to our customers’ and communities’ needs.</h3>
  <p>By listening carefully to our customer needs, we have been enhancing the way we serve and interact with our customers. From quickly pivoting our operations during the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to provide vital services to customers, to taking a multi-initiative approach to inequality, we see our service as much more than just providing energy but creating a more equitable society. During the peak of the pandemic, Southern Company Gas led and supported our customers and employees through multiple energy and bill payment assistance programs. In addition, Southern Company Gas, along with the Charitable Foundation, invested over $2.5 million to support relief efforts in our service territories.</p>


  <h3 class="hed--small">We help our employees thrive.</h3>
  <p>Much of our impact is made possible through our engaged and diverse workforce, who are not only employees at Southern Company Gas, but residents ofthe communities we serve. Every day, we strive to create an environment where our employees can thrive. Central to our strategy is promoting and maintaining an inclusive culture for a diverse workforce. We have invested heavily in D&I initiatives that have proven to be effective, contributing to a 92% overall Engagement Index and a sense of satisfaction and pride in working for Southern Company Gas. This internal engagement has translated to the highest levels of community engagement and customer satisfaction and earned our natural gas utilities the recognition as some of the most trusted brands in energy.</p>


  <h3 class="hed--small">We are taking steps to scale our impact.</h3>
  <p>We’ve already recognized many achievements toward our environmental and social-responsibility goals that I’m very proud of at Southern Company Gas. The scale of those achievements is due, in no small part, to establishing a responsible governance structure, in which leaders and departments are aligned in values and goals. In the past couple of years, we’ve added top industry experts to our leadership team to drive growth in innovation, customer service, community and employee engagement, economic development, sustainability and financial success.</p>

  <p>It is also a testament of our governance structure and talented leaders that, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Southern Company Gas exceeded 2020 financial goals, as measured by net income. Importantly, we did so while continuing to focus on customers, providing support to impacted communities and maintaining momentum to important safety and operational initiatives. This achievement is a direct reflection of the company’s resiliency and agility.</p>

  <p>Our mission to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy is inherently a multi-dimensional one. We don’t prioritize one action over the other but recognize that they must be pursued in tandem. We are excited to continue this journey and build a clean and equitable future with you.</p>
