  <h1 class="hed hed--large">A Path To Environmental Sustainability</h1>
  <p>We have one earth. With the environmental impacts of climate change becoming more urgent every year, we must work together to create a cleaner planet for future generations. As the President and CEO of one of the largest natural gas companies in the nation, I am determined to protect our environment while fulfilling our mission of delivering life-essential clean, safe, affordable and reliable energy to our more than 4.2 million customers.</p>

  <p>We at Southern Company are committed to our goal of achieving a low-to no-carbon future by decarbonizing our operations across all enterprises by 2050. As one of the largest energy companies in the nation, we can’t just focus on one area of operations at a time to reach our net-zero goal by 2050. That’s why we’re implementing a portfolio-wide approach focused on energy innovation to keep our planet healthy for generations to come. </p>

  <h2 class="hed--medium">Our Impact so far</h2>
  <p>Over the past 20 years, we have invested more than $2.2 billion in improving and replacing pipeline infrastructure to minimize methane emissions and, most recently, Southern Company Gas achieved 99.9% efficiency of its distribution system in its delivery of natural gas. As of 2020, Southern Company Gas’ total fugitive methane emissions represented less than 1% of Southern Company’s direct facility emissions. In total, from 1998 to 2018, modernizing infrastructure mitigated the equivalent of 3.3 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from our natural gas distribution system, equal to removing over 700,000 cars from the road for one year. In addition, we also transitioned millions of customers to paperless billing, saving nearly $4.4 million in paper, ink and postage, and offsetting 6.7 million pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>

  <p>We don’t just meet EPA requirements; we voluntarily set more aggressive goals and consider additional emissions sources beyond existing EPA requirements.We also understand our customers are searching for ways to reduce their own carbon footprint—that’s why we offer our customers extensive energy efficiency programs and services that allow them to take control of their own energy use.</p>

  <h2 class="hed--medium">Leading the Way</h2>
  <p>Southern Company Gas is leading the way to implementing Renewable Natural Gas (RNG), a fully interchangeable alternative to natural gas derived from biogenic or other renewable energy resources capable of reducing GHG emissions by up to 400%. Our Atlanta Gas Light subsidiary has two interconnection tariffs for third parties to connect and transport RNG on its systems,and Virginia Natural Gas recently filed a similar tariff. Furthermore, in September 2020, Southern Gas filed a request for an interconnection program that would enable Nicor Gas to invest up to $20 million across its portfolio, or up to $4 million per project, to help RNG developers offset capital costs. We’re proud to share that Nicor Gas received a 2020 Inspiring Efficiency award from Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance.</p>

  <h2 class="hed--medium">At The Forefront Of Research And Development</h2>
  <p>Southern Company Gas has a robust industry partnership approach to R&D to discover new solutions. For example, our new initiative on HyBlend aims to address the technical barriers to blending hydrogen in natural gas infrastructure and study life-cycle emissions of hydrogen blends. Blending hydrogen into the existing natural gas infrastructure has national and regional benefits for energy storage, resiliency and emissions reductions. In addition to Southern Company Gas, the HyBlend team is comprised of six DOE national laboratories and more than 20 participants from industry and academia.</p>

  <p>Southern Company Gas is also investing in as power-to-gas technologies, which convert excess renewable energy into gas that can be efficiently stored and transported over great distances to be utilized days, weeks or months later to provide power and heat in other far-away locations.</p>

  <p>Lastly, Southern Company Gas is partnering with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), the Gas Technology Institute (GTI) and countless other utilities on the Low-Carbon Resources Initiative (LCRI) — a five-year initiative to evaluate and scale cutting-edge technologies that will advance the gas and energy utility sector toward meeting ambitious emissions goals.</p>

  <h2 class="hed--medium">The Communities We Serve</h2>
  <p>Our environmental efforts extend into the communities we serve and their natural resources. Southern Company has a long and established history of environmental stewardship and long-held partnerships with environmental conservation organizations, having invested over $21 million in 385 grants to restore or enhance over 1.9 million acres of natural habitat. A few of our conservation efforts include longleaf pine restoration, Chattahoochee nature trails preservation, prairie restoration, Tennessee River Rescue, the Elizabeth River Trail and restoration of city parks.</p>

  <p>In 2020, we launched the Green Team, a corporate-sponsored, employee-led grassroots organization that aims to empower its communities to be more sustainable. The Green Team creates opportunities to build awareness, promote conversation and biodiversity, build relationships with community allies, and educate and inspire stakeholders. Together, we can work toward a cleaner, greener future for our generation and for those to come.</p>
